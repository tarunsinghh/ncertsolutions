<p>10,1</p>




<p><strong><em>Question 2:Which of the following experiments have equally likely outcomes,Explain.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>i)The driver attempts to start a car.The car starts or does not start.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>This experiment doesn not have equally likely outcomes</p>
<p><strong>ii)A player attempts to shoot a basketball.She/he shoots or misses the ball.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>This experiment doesn not have equally likely outcomes</p>
<p><strong>iii)A trial is made to answer a true false question.The answer is right or wrong.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>This experiment  have equally likely outcomes,beacuse the naswer can be right or wrong nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>iv)A baby is born.It is a boy or a girl.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Question 3:Why is tossing a coin considered to be a fair way of deciding which team should get the
ball at the beginning of a football game?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>When we toss a coin, the outcomes head and tail are equally likely. So, the result of an
individual coin toss is completely unpredictable.</p>


<p><strong><em>Question 4:Which of the following cannot be the probability of an event?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>a)\(\frac{2}{3}        )</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>\frac{2}{3} = .66 which is less than 1 so this can be the probabilty of an event</p>
<p><strong>b)\( -1.5       )</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>As -1.5 < 0,it cant be the probabilty of an event</p>

<p><strong>c)\(15 %       )</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>


<p><strong>d)\(0.7     )</strong></p>
<p>0<= .0.7 <=1,so this can be the probabilty of an event</p>




<p><strong><em>Question 5:If P(E) = 0.05, what is the probability of ‘not E’?
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>We know that p(E) + p(not E) = 1</p>
<p>so p(not E) = 1 - p(E) </p>
<p>so p(not E) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 </p>



<p><strong><em>Question 6:A bag contains lemon flavoured candies only. Malini takes out one candy without
looking into the bag. What is the probability that she takes out
(i) an orange flavoured candy?
(ii) a lemon flavoured candy?
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>i)Since the bag does not contain any orange flavoured candy,the probabilty that she takes out an orange flavoured candy = 0 </p>
<p>ii)Since the bag  contains all lemon  flavoured candy,the probabilty that she takes out an lemon flavoured candy = 1 </p>


<p><strong><em>Question 7:It is given that in a group of 3 students, the probability of 2 students not having the same birthday is 0.992. What is the probability that the 2 students have the same birthday?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>let p(E) = the probability of 2 students not having the same birthday</p>
<p>then p(not E) = probability that the 2 students have the same birthday</p>
<p>We know that p(E) + P(not E) = 1,p(not E) = 1 - p(E) = 1 - 0.992 = 0.008</p>



<p><strong><em>Question 8:A bag contains 3 red balls and 5 black balls. A ball is drawn at random from the bag.
What is the probability that the ball drawn is (i) red ? (ii) not red?
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>let E = ball drawn is red</p>
<p>p(E) = \frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 3</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 5</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{3}{5}\)</p>
<p>p( not E) = p(not Red) = 1 - p(Red) = 1 - \frac{3}{5} =  \frac{2}{5}</p>


<p><strong><em>Question 9:A box contains 5 red marbles, 8 white marbles and 4 green marbles. One marble is taken
out of the box at random. What is the probability that the marble taken out will be (i) red ? (ii) white ? (iii) not green?
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>let E = marble  drawn is red</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}\)</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 5(as their are 5 red marbles)</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 5 + 8 + 4 = 17</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{5}{17}\)</p>
<p>let E = marble  drawn is white</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}\)</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 8(as their are 8 white marbles)</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 5 + 8 + 4 = 17</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{8}{17}\)</p>
<p>let E = marble  drawn is green</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}\)</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 4(as their are 4 red marbles)</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 5 + 8 + 4 = 17</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{4}{17}\)</p>



<p><strong><em>Question 10:A piggy bank contains hundred 50p coins, fifty ` 1 coins, twenty ` 2 coins and ten ` 5
coins. If it is equally likely that one of the coins will fall out when the bank is turned upside down, what is the probability that the coin (i) will be a 50 p coin ? (ii) will not be a  5 coin?
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>let E = coin fall out will be a 50p coin</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}\)</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 100(as their are 5 red marbles)</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 100 + 50 + 20 + 10  = 180</p>


<p>let E = will not be a  5 coin</p>
<p>Now there are two ways to find this ,either you directly find this probabilty or you find the probability of getting 5 coin and then find the probability of not 5 by subtracting from 1 using p(E) + p(not E) = 1,we will use both ways</p>

<p>let E = will not be a  5 coin</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 100 + 50 + 20(not 5 rs coin means coin can be of 50p,1,2)</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 100 + 50 + 20 + 10  = 180</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{170}{180} = \frac{17}{18}\)</p>

<p>let E = will  be a  5 coin</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes =  10</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 100 + 50 + 20 + 10  = 180</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{10}{180} = \frac{17}{18}\)</p>
<p>p(not E) = 1 - p(E) = \(\frac{17}{18}\)

<p>let E = fish taken out is male</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 5</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 5 + 8  = 13</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{5}{13} \)</p>

<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9} \)</p>

<p>let E = sum of 10 will show up</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(4,6),(6,4),(5,5)} = 3</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 36</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \)</p>

<p>let E = sum of 11 will show up</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(5,6),(6,5)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 36</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18} \)</p>

<p>let E = sum of 12 will show up</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(6,6)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 36</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{1}{36}  \)</p>


<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>ii)These 11 outcomes are not equally likely since throwing up two dices gives you combination of numbers on both dices not the sum ,the sum is a question formed over it.</p>



<p><strong><em>Question 23:A game consists of tossing a one rupee coin 3 times and noting its outcome each time.
Hanif wins if all the tosses give the same result i.e., three heads or three tails, and loses
otherwise. Calculate the probability that Hanif will lose the game.
</em></strong></p>
<p>let E = Hanif will loose</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(H,H,T),(T,H,H),(H,T,T),(T,T,H),(H,T,H),(T,H,T)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = {(H,H,T),(T,H,H),(H,T,T),(T,T,H),(H,T,H),(T,H,T),(H,H,H),(T,T,T)}</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{6}{8}  = \frac{3}{4} \)</p>



<p>Also you can more easily solve it if you calculate probability of hanif will win and then subtracting from 1 </p>
<p>let E = Hanif will win</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(H,H,H),(T,T,T)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = {(H,H,T),(T,H,H),(H,T,T),(T,T,H),(H,T,H),(T,H,T),(H,H,H),(T,T,T)}</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{2}{8}  = \frac{1}{4} \)</p>
<p>Now using p(E) = 1 - p (not E) =  ,p(hanif will loose) = \frac{3}{4}</p>






<p><strong><em>Question 24:A die is thrown twice. What is the probability that

</em></strong></p>

<p>i)let E = 5 will not come up either time </p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(H,H,H),(T,T,T)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = {(H,H,T),(T,H,H),(H,T,T),(T,T,H),(H,T,H),(T,H,T),(H,H,H),(T,T,T)}</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{2}{8}  = \frac{1}{4} \)</p>

<p><strong><em>Question 25:Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not correct? Give reasons
for your answer.
(i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes —two
heads, two tails or one of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the
1
probability is ⋅
3
(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes— an odd number or an even

<p><strong>Exercise 15.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1:Two customers Shyam and Ekta are visiting a particular shop in the same week (Tuesday
to Saturday). Each is equally likely to visit the shop on any day as on another day. What
is the probability that both will visit the shop on (i) the same day? (ii) consecutive
days? (iii) different days?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>i)There are 5 days from tuesday to saturday</p>
<p>Now if the question was to find the probabilty of visiting on a particular day like say wednesday for wither Shyam or Ekta</p>
<p>then this probabilty = \frac{1}{5} </p>
<p>Lets find out the probabilty of Shyam and Ekta visting on tuesday</p>
<p>probabilty that SHyam will visit on tuesday = \(  \frac{1}{5}        \)
<p>probabilty that Ekta will visit  on tuesday = \(  \frac{1}{5}        \)
<p>probabilty that Shyam and Ekta will both  visit  on tuesday = \(  \frac{1}{5}\times \frac{1}{5} =  \frac{1}{25} \)
<p>Now similarly the probabilty that Shyam and Ekta will visit on wednesday = \(  \frac{1}{25}        \)
<p>so the probabilty that Shyam and Ekta will visit on same day =  \(  \frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{25}  + \frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{25}  + \frac{1}{25}  =   \frac{1}{5} \)



ii)<p>For consective days the scenarios are :</p>
<p>Shyam visits on tuesday,Ekta on wednesday</p>
<p>Ekta visits on tuesday,Shyam on wednesday</p>

<p>Shyam visits on wednesday,Ekta on thursday</p>
<p>Ekta  visits on wednesday,Shyam on thursday</p>

<p>Shyam visits on thursday,Ekta on friday</p>
<p>Ekta  visits on thursday,Shyam on friday</p>

<p>Shyam visits on friday,Ekta on saturday</p>
<p>Ekta  visits on friday,Shyam on saturday</p>

<p>probabilty on visting a particular day  = \(  \frac{1}{5} \)</p>
<p>so probability that both will visit the shop on consecutive days = \frac{1}{25}\times 8</p>


iii)<p>possible scenarios are</p>
<p>Since we havs to 3 of daye already find out probabilty of both reaching on same day,we can easily find out the probabilty of both reaching on different day by using p(E) + P(not E) = 1</p>
<p>p(reaching on different day) = 1 - p(reaching on same day) = 1 - \(  \frac{1}{5}          \) = {4}{5}</p>
<p><strong>Can you solve this question by using the way of part 2 means listing all the cases of both reaching on different<br/> day and then summing up the proabilities,if its becoming difficult you can limit the number i.e both visits on only three days tuesday,wednesday,thursday.Your answer should come\( 1 -p(both visits on same day) = 1 - (\frac{1}{3}) = \frac{2}{3} \) </strong></p>




<p><strong><em>Question 3:A bag contains 5 red balls and some blue balls. If the probability of drawing a blue ball
is double that of a red ball, determine the number of blue balls in the bag?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Let there are x blue balls</p>

<p>let E1 = drawing a blue ball</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = x</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = x + 5</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{x}{x + 5}   \)</p>


<p>let E2 = drawing a red ball</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = 5</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = x + 5</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{5}{x + 5}   \)</p>

<p>Now according to the question</p>
<p>\(   \frac{x}{x + 5} = 2(\frac {5}{x + 5})  \)</p>
<p>\(   \frac{x}{x + 5} = \frac {10}{x + 5}  \)</p>
<p> x = 10</p>

(ii) 6?
(iii) at least 6?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>i)let E1 = total score is even</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(1,1),(1,3),(1,3),(3,1),(3,1),(2,2),(2,2),(2,2),(2,2),(3,3),(3,3),(3,3),(3,3),(2,6),(2,6),(6,2),(6,2),(6,6)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 36</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{18}{36} = \frac{1}{2}   \)</p>

<p>ii)let E1 = total score is 6</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(3,3),(3,3),(3,3),(3,3)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 36</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}   \)</p>

<p>number of favorable outcomes = {(1,2),(1,2),(2,1),(2,1),(1,3),(1,3),(3,1),(3,1),(2,3),(2,3),(2,3),(2,3)}</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 36</p>
<p>p(E) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}=\( \frac{12}{36} = \frac{1}{3}   \)</p>

<p><strong><em>Question 4:A box contains 12 balls out of which x are black. If one ball is drawn at random from the
box, what is the probability that it will be a black ball? If 6 more black balls are put in the box, the probability of drawing a black ball is now double of what it was before. Find x.?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Let there are x blue balls</p>

<p>let E1 = drawing a black ball</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = x</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 12</p>
<p>p(E1) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{x}{12}   \)</p>

<p>After putting 6 more black balls</p>
<p>p(E1) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{x + 6}{18}   \)</p>

<p>Now according to the question</p>
<p>\(   \frac{x + 6}{18} = 2(\frac {x}{12})  \)</p>
<p>\(   \frac{x+6}{18} = \frac {x}{6}  \)</p>
<p> 18x = 6x + 36</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Let there are x green balls</p>

<p>let E1 = drawing a green ball</p>
<p>number of favorable outcomes = x</p>
<p>total number of  outcomes = 24</p>
<p>p(E1) = \(\frac{number of favorable outcomes}{total number of outcomes}= \frac{x}{24}   \)</p>
