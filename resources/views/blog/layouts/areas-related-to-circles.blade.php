<p><strong><em>1. The radii of two circles are 19 cm and 9 cm respectively.
Find the radius of the circle which has circumference equal to the sum of the circumferences of the two circles.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>According to question:
<p>\( 2\pi\times 19 + 2\pi\times 9 = 2\pi\times R        \)</p>
<p>\( 38\pi + 18\pi = 2\pi\times R        \)</p>
<p>\( 56\pi = 2\pi\times R        \)</p>
<p>\( R     = 28cm   \)</p>


<p><strong>2. The radii of two circles are 8 cm and 6 cm respectively. Find
the radius of the circle having area equal to the sum of the
areas of the two circles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>According to question:
<p>\( \pi\times 8^{2} + \pi\times 6^{2} = \pi\times R^{2}        \)</p>
<p>\( 64\pi + 36\pi = \pi\times R^{2}        \)</p>
<p>\( 100 = \pi\times R^{2}        \)</p>
<p>\( R     = 10cm   \)</p>

<p><strong>3. Fig. 12.3 depicts an archery target marked with its five
scoring regions from the centre outwards as Gold, Red, Blue,Black and White. The diameter of the region representing
Gold score is 21 cm and each of the other bands is 10.5 cm wide. Find the area of each of the five scoring regions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-1-3.png" alt="8" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>Radius of gold region = \( \frac{21}{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of Red region = \(  \pi\times (\frac{21}{2})^{2}   = 346.5  \)</p>
<p>Area of Blue region = \(  \pi\times 21^{2} -    \pi\times (\frac{21}{2})^{2}  = 330.75\pi  \)</p>
<p>Area of Black region = \(  \pi\times (\frac{63}{2})^{2} -    \pi\times 21^{2}  = 551.25\pi  \)</p>
<p>Area of White region = \(  \pi\times 42^{2} -    \pi\times (\frac{63}{2})^{2}  = 771.75\pi  \)</p>



<p><strong>4. The wheels of a car are of diameter 80 cm each. How many complete revolutions does
each wheel make in 10 minutes when the car is travelling at a speed of 66 km per hour?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Diametre = 80 cm,radius = 40 cm</p>
<p>Distance covered in pure revolution = \(  2\pi\times 40 = 80 \pi   cm              \)   </p>
<p><strong><em>(If this would have come in IIT JEE examination ,the question would be incomplete because it happens only in the case of pure rolling )</em></strong></p>
<p>Speed of car = \( \frac{66\times 1000\times 100}{60\times}\) = 110000  m per minute</p>
<p>Lets car take n revolutions in 10 minutes</p>
<p>Distance travelled in 10 minutes  = \( 110000\times 10  \)</p>
<p>so \(  80\pi\times n = 1100000           \)                             </p>
<p>so \(  n = 4375           \)                             </p>
<p>so the car makes 4375 revolutions </p>


<p><strong>5.Tick the correct answer in the following and justify your choice : If the perimeter and the
area of a circle are numerically equal, then the radius of the circle is
(B) π units
(C) 4 units
(D) 7 units.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>According to question:
<p>\( 2\pi\times R  = \pi\times R^{2}        \)</p>
<p>\( 2R  = R^{2}        \)</p>
<p>\(  R^{2} - 2R = 0        \)</p>
<p>\(  R(R - 2) = 0        \)</p>
<p> R cant be zero so R = 2  </p>



<p><strong>EXERCISE – 12.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Find the area of a sector of a circle with radius 6 cm if angle of the sector is 60°.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>\(Area of sector = \frac{\theta}{360}\times \pi\times r^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(Area of sector = \frac{\theta}{360}\times \pi\times r^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(Area of sector = \frac{60}{360}\times \pi\times 6^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(Area of sector =  \pi\times 6 = 6\pi  = \frac{132}{7} \)</p>



<p><strong>2.Find the area of a quadrant of a circle whose circumference is 22 cm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Quadrant means \(  \frac{1}{4}\) of the circle so angle of sector = 90         </p>
<p>\(2 \pi\times r = 22,r = \frac{7}{2} \)</p>

<p>Area of sector =\( \frac{\theta}{360}\times \pi\times r^{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of sector = \( \frac{90}{360}\times \pi\times (\frac{7}{2})^{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of sector = \(  \frac{1}{4}\times \pi\times \frac{49}{4}  \)</p>
<p>Area of quadrant = \( \frac{77}{8} cm^{2} \)</p>



<p><strong>3.The length of the minute hand of a clock is 14 cm. Find the area swept by the minute
hand in 5 minutes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>in 60 minutes it completes one rvolution,so thats covering 360 in 60 minutes</p>
<p>in 1 minute it sweeps \(  \frac{360}{60}  = 6 degree     \)</p>
<p>in 5 minutes it sweeps \(   6\times 5 = 30 degree     \)</p>
<p>\(Area of sector = \frac{\theta}{360}\times \pi\times r^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(Area of sector = \frac{30}{360}\times \pi\times 14^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(Area of sector = \frac{1}{12}\times 22\times 2\times 14 \)</p>
<p>\(Area of sector = \frac{1}{3}\times 11\times  14 \)</p>
<p>so area swept by minute hand in 5 minute = \(   \frac{1}{3}\times 11\times  14   = \frac{154}{3} cm^{2}  \)</p>



<p><strong>4. A chord of a circle of radius 10 cm subtends a right angle at the centre. Find the area of
the corresponding : (i) minor segment (ii) major sector. (Use π = 3.14)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-1-12-2-4.png" alt="8" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>Area of major sector \( = \frac{\theta}{360}\times \pi\times r^{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of major sector \( = \frac{270}{360}\times \pi\times 10^{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of minor sector \( = area of circle - area of major sector =  25\times 3.14 =  78.5  \)</p>
<p>Area of triangle  \( = \frac{1}{2}(OA\times OB) = \frac{1}{2}(10\times 10)  = 50  \)</p>
<p>Area of minor segment  = area of minor sector - area of triangle =  78.5 - 50 = 28.5 \( cm^{2} \)  </p>




<p><strong>5. In a circle of radius 21 cm, an arc subtends an angle of 60° at the centre. Find:
(i) the length of the arc
(ii) area of the sector formed by the arc
(iii) area of the segment formed by the corresponding chord</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-1-12-2-5.png" alt="8" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>Some students will panic we only know how to find the area of sector ,we dont know how to find length of arc</p>
<p>But its simple,\( 2\pi\times r \) subtents 360 at centre so you just need to apply unitary method like we did in finding area of sector</p>
<p>so length of arc = \(  \frac{60}{360}(  2\pi\times 21                 )  \)</p> 
<p>so length of arc = \(  22 cm                    \)</p> 
<p>Area of  sector \( = \frac{60}{360}\times \pi\times 21^{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of  sector \( =   11\times  21  =  231   \)</p>
<p>Since the sector makes an angle  60 and OA = OB which gives OAB = OBA(Angle opposite to equal sides are equal)</p>
<p>Now ∠AOB + ∠OAB + ∠OBA = 180</p>
<p>60 + 2 ∠OAB = 180,∠AOB = 60,∠OBA = 60  </p>
<p>Now since it is an equilateral triangle the area of trinagle OAB = \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\times 21^{2} = \frac{441\sqrt{3}}{4} \)</p>

<p>Area of  segment = area of  sector - area of triangle = 441 - \( \frac{231\sqrt{3}}{4}  cm^{2} \)</p>


<p><strong>6. A chord of a circle of radius 15 cm subtends an angle of 60° at the centre. Find the areas
of the corresponding minor and major segments of the circle.
(Use π = 3.14 and 3 = 1.73)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p> 
<p>Now this is very similar to previous question,only difference is radius = 15</p>
<p>Area of minor sector \( = \frac{60}{360}\times \pi\times 15^{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of minor sector \( = \frac{1}{6}\times 3.14\times 225 =  117.75 cm^{2} \)</p>

<p>Area of triangle OPQ(its a equilateral triangle like previous question =  \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\times 15^{2} = 97.3125 cm^{2}    \)</p>

<p>Area of minor segment = area of sector - area of triangle = 117.75 - 97.3125 = 20.4375 \( cm^{2} \)</p>

<p>Area of major  segment = area of circle - area of minor segment \( =  \pi\times 15^{2} - 20.4375 = 686.0625 cm^{2}     \)</p>




<p><strong>7. A chord of a circle of radius 12 cm subtends an angle of 120° at the centre. Find the area of the
corresponding segment of the circle.
(Use π = 3.14 and 3 = 1.73)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-1-12-2-7.png" alt="8" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Now this time the angle is not 60 or 90 so we will have to find the area by  other way  and the other way is also very simple</em></strong></p>

<p>Draw a perpendicular from 0 to line segment AB at M</p>
<p>Now consider triangle OAM and OBM,by R.H.S congruence condition</p>
<p> AOM = MOB = 60              </p>
<p>In triangle OAM </p>
<p>\(  sin 60 = \frac{AM}{12} = 6{\sqrt{3}}  \)</p>
<p>Length of chord  = 2AM = \( 12\sqrt{3} \)</p>
<p>Area of triangle  OAB \( = \frac{1}{2}(12\times 12\sqrt{3} = 36 \sqrt{3} = 62.28 cm^{2}  \)</p>
<p>Area of sector  =  \( \frac{120}{360} ( \pi\times 12^{2}) =   150.72 cm^{2}  \)  
<p>Area of segment  = 150.72 - 62.28 = \( 88.44 cm^{2} \) </p>



<p><strong>8. A horse is tied to a peg at one corner of a square
shaped grass field of side 15 m by means of a 5 m
long rope (see Fig. 12.11). Find
(i) the area of that part of the field in which the
horse can graze.
(ii) the increase in the grazing area if the rope were
10 m long instead of 5 m. (Use π = 3.14)
Fig. 12.11</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-2-8.png" alt="8" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>The horse will move along a circle,we have to find area of sector with angle = 90 </p>
<p>\(Area of  sector = \frac{90}{360}\times 3.14\times 5^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(Area of  sector = \frac{1}{4}\times 3.14\times 25  =   19.625 \)</p>
<p>so horse can graze around  </p>


<p>Increase in graze area = area of sector with r = 10m - area of sector with r = 5m</p>
<p> = \(  \frac{90}{360}\times 3.14      (10^{2} - 5^{2}) \)</p>
<p> =  \( \frac{1}{4}\times 3.14 (15\times 5)  = 58.875 cm^{2} \)</p>



<p><strong>9. A brooch is made with silver wire in the form of a
circle with diameter 35 mm. The wire is also used in
making 5 diameters which divide the circle into 10
equal sectors as shown in Fig. 12.12. Find :
(i) the total length of the silver wire required.
(ii) the area of each sector of the brooch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-2-9.png" alt="8" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>total length of the silver wire required = perimtere of circle + length of 5 diametres </p>
<p = \( 2\times \frac{22}{7}\times \frac{35}{2} +   5\times 35 \) </p>
<p> = \(  22\times 5 +   5\times 35  =  110 + 175 = 285 mm \) </p>

<p>Since 5 dimatres divided the circle into 10 equal parts</p>
<p>Area of  each sector of brooch \(= \frac{36}{360}\times \frac{22}{7}\times (\frac{35}{2})^{2} = \frac{385}{4}  \)</p>


<p><strong>10.An umbrella has 8 ribs which are equally spaced (see Fig. 12.13). Assuming umbrella to be a flat circle

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-2-10.png" alt="8" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>Simialr to previous question:we need to find area  of sector,there are 8 equal ribs,so we have to find area of sectoe with angle = \( \frac{360}{8} = 45     \) </p>
<p>Area between consecutive ribs \( = \frac{45}{360}\times \frac{22}{7}\times  45^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(  = \frac{1}{8}\times \frac{22}{7}\times  45^{2} = \frac{22275}{28} cm^{2}  \)</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>The angle sweeped will  be 90 if you have seen car wipers</p>
<p>total area cleaned at each sweep of the blades = \(  2( \frac{115}{360}\times \frac{22}{7}\times  25^{2}                  )     =  \frac{158125}{126}  cm^{2}       \)  </p>

over which the ships are warned. (Use π = 3.14).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>r = 16.5,angle of sector = 80</p>
<p>\(Area of  sector = \frac{80}{360}\times 3.14\times 16.5^{2} \)</p>
<p>\(Area of  sector = \frac{2}{9}\times 3.14\times 16.5^{2} \)</p>
<p>Area of the sea over which the ships are warned =\( \frac{2}{9}\times 3.14\times 16.5^{2} =  189.97 cm^{2} \)</p>

<p>Now we will have to find area of triangle OAB</p>
<p>We can find it easily using drawing a perpendicular and then applying pythagoras theorem</p>
<p>But we observe AOB = 60,OA = OB,this gives  OAB = OBA,2 OAB + 60 = 180</p>
<p>so all angles are equal ,triangle OAB is an equilateral triangle</p>
<p>Area of equilateral triangle = \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\times a^{2}  =  \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\times 28^{2} = 333.2      \)</p>
<p>Area of segment APB = \(   \frac{1232}{3} - 333.2 = 464.8        \)</p>

<p>If you remember angle inscribed in semicircle is a right angle(Do you know the proof,if not,please revise it)</p>
<p>Areaof triangle RQP = \( \frac{1}{2}(24\times 7) = 84 cm^{2}   \)</p>
<p>Since triangle OPR is right angled triangle</p>
<p>RQ = \( \sqrt{ 24^{2} + 7^{2} } = \sqrt{ 576 + 49} = 25  \)     }
<p>Area of semicircle = \( \frac{1}{2}(\pi\times (\frac{25}{2})^{2} = \frac{6875}{28} )                    \)

<p>The question is simple the required area is difference of area of sector areas</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-3-4.png" alt="8" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>This is a good question,there are two ways to solve it</p>
<p>Either you add area of triangle + area of major sector with angle 360 - 60 = 300</p>
<p>or you add area of triangle + area of circle - area of small sector with angle 60</p>
<p>We are subtracting area of small sector with angle 60 because we have included this area twice times,once in area of circle and once in area of trinagle,so need to subtract once ,cant subtract twice,we still need that area</p>
<p><strong><em>Can you draw some similarty to the set intersection formula ,A UNION B = A + B - A INTERSECTION B </em></strong></p>
<p>we will use first approach</p>
<p>Area of shaded region =  area of major sector + area of triangle </p>
<p>Area of shaded region = \(\frac{300}{360}(\pi\times 6^{2}) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}( 12^{2} ) \)</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-3-5.png" alt="8" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>This is also simple,from area of square we have to subtract area of 4 sectors which is equivalent to a circle and then we have to subtract area of circle at the centre too</p>
<p>Area of remaining square = \(  4^{2} - 4 (\frac{90}{360}(\pi\times 1^{2}) - \pi\times 1^{2}   \)</p>
<p>Area of remaining square = \(  16 - \frac{22}{7} - \frac{22}{7}   \)</p>
<p>Area of remaining square = \(  16 - \frac{44}{7}   \)</p>
<p>Area of remaining square = \(  \frac{112 - 44}{7} = \frac{68}{7}  \)</p>

<p>Lets draw a line from A to BC at point D ,such that angle ADC =90,that is we are drawing a altitude,since in a equilateral triangle altitude is median too and all passes through the centre of inscribed and circumscribed circle ,AO:0D = 2:1</p>
<p> \( \frac{AO}{OD}      = \frac{2}{1} \)</p> 
<p>\( \frac{AO}{AD - AO} = \frac{2}{1} \)</p> 
<p>\( 2AD - 2AO       = AO \)</p> 
<p>\( 2AD             = 3AO \)</p> 
<p>\( AD              = \frac{3}{2}AO \)</p> 
<p>\( AD              =   48       \)</p>


<p>In triangle OAD</p>
<p>using pythagoras theorem in triangle BOD </p>
<p>BD = \( \sqrt{(OB^{2} - OD^{2})} =  \sqrt{(32^{2} - 16^{2})} =  \sqrt{ 48\times 16  } = 16\sqrt{3}   ( OD = \frac{1}{2}AO ) \) </p>
<p>so area of triangle = \(  \frac{1}{2} (  32\sqrt{3}\times 48       ) = 768\sqrt{3}     \)</p>
<p><strong>There is one alternate way too find area of trianangle,using pythagoras in ABD = \(  AB^{2} = 48^{2} + (\frac{AB}{2})^{2}      \) and then use formula for area of equilateral triangle</strong></p>

<p>so area of design  = area of circle - area of triangle = \( \pi\times 32^{2} - 768\sqrt{3} = \frac{22528}{7} - 768\sqrt{3} \)</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-3-8.png" alt="8" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>This is simple too,the only thing is how you decompose the given figure</p>
<p>There are two rectangles ,length is quite large in compare to breadth and then there are two semicircles with different radius at corners</p>
<p>Distance along inner edge = \( 2\times 106 + 2\times \frac{22}{7}\times 30  \)</p>
<p>Distance along inner edge = \( 212 +  \frac{1320}{7} = \frac{2804}{7}   \)</p>

<p>ii)Required area = \(  2(106\times 10) + \pi ( (30 +10)^{2} - 30^{2} )                 \)</p>
<p> = \(  2120 + \pi ( 40 + 30 )(40 - 30)                 \)</p>
<p> = \(  2120 + \pi\times 700                 \)</p>
<p> = \(  2120 + 2\times 100 = 2120 + 2200 = 4320 cm^{2} \)</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2112" src="/10-0-12-3-10.png" alt="8" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>This is again so simple,equilateral triangle so angle = 60,we have to just find area of sectors a nd subtract it from area of trianglw which is given in the question</p>
<p>Area of shaded region = \(  17320.5 - 3(\frac{60}{360}(3.14\times a^{2}    ))\)                                     
<p>Now side of triangle is not given,thats why area is given </p>
<p>\( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\times a^{2} = 17320.5 \)</p>
